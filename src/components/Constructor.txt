The campaign mission is to work with indigeneous people across the globe to preserve their artforms and culture through music by providing them a platform tailored to highlight their true sounds. The true sound program by earth studio will play the role of an enabler to bring the sounds of nature and their unique traditional instruments to the forefront. At Earth Studio we work through partnerships with local organisations and empower the indigeneous people. We support network building and knowledge sharing, and we also intend to provide grants and capacity development to indigeneous people's organisation and institutions.
